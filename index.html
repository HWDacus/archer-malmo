<!-- Sorry. I got kinda lazy with this. I really wanted to add more to this, but I've been crunched for time all of this week, and I've been prioritizing other things.-->

		<p>I knew little of Archer-Malmo prior to the field trip, and little of design / web groups in general. I originally thought it would just be a bunch of people working behind cubicles, completing really monotonous tasks. However, I quickly learned that even if it may seem like the work is really monotonous and boring, there's more than meets the eye. I already like coding, so it wasn't terribly hard to notice this, but I was aware of how it could become repetitive.</p>

		<p>I was unfortunately kind of dead for most of the trip, as I had taken two tests that morning right before we left, and was working off of two or three hour sleep. I'm not sure what motivated me, but I was able to maintain myself and my presence. I absolutely did not want to fall asleep during Archer-Malmo's presentation, because that's super rude and I'm not about that. Their presentation was actually cool and informative, and very nice of them to put the extra work in to present to us.</p>

		<p>I was sort of shocked and happy to find out my idea of a dull office was clearly the wrong idea in comparison to Archer-Malmo. First of all, bringing dogs to work is pretty cool. I wouldn't personally do it, but it's neat. I also really liked / appreciated the care for the employees. Most of all, I was really impressed and motivated at the motivation the employees had for their work. Something about that sparked a little of something in me. Only a little. I'm still really lazy.</p>

		<p>I left with what I think is a better of idea of the field that I'm interested in. Archer-Malmo gave me helpful information and insight to the workplace. I didn't think it'd be so lax. I also like how they explained the topics at hand and gave us a tour. Overall they came off as super approachable and chill people. Reminds me that people who work are sitll people.</p>

		<p>Now for something totally irrelevant to the core point of the trip. I  l o v e  Cook Out. It's so good. You can get so much GOOD food for CHEAP. It's rad. Honestly been looking foward to eating it for lunch for a week now. It's even more rad that there's one in Bartlett now. The shakes are also cool, and there's a ton of them. Cook Out is good.</p>
